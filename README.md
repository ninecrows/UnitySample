# UnitySample
Sample unity project with some movement controls and camera activity.

I've been away from Unity for a few years doing work stuff (fun with network crypto for a proprietary network protocol) and I was mostly focused on VR stuff last time I i played with it.

Coming back I am realizing how much I've forgotten so I'm putting together a very simple sample to refresh memories.

This will probably top out with the ability to move a sphere around in two dimensions with the camera following it as it goes.

After that I'll likely move on to a simple space invader like game to put real pieces together and have something more interesting to share.
